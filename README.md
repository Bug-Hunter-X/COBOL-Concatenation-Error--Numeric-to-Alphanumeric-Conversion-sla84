This repository demonstrates a common error in COBOL programs involving the concatenation of numeric and alphanumeric data.  The `bug.cob` file shows the erroneous code, which attempts to concatenate an index with a string literal without proper type conversion.  The `bugSolution.cob` file provides a corrected version using the `STRING` or `UNSTRING` verbs to handle the conversion, thereby avoiding the runtime error.
